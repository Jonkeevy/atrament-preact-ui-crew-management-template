    This template is themed around a band going on tour. The player is the band manager and a performer. They must recruit bandmates and crew, invest in equipment, drive to the next stop on the tour - all while making enough money to keep going.
    
    Fail states: No money for fuel, no band, van breaks down.
    
    This template is a for an narrative game with mostly static NPCS. It assumes the player is going between different characters and locations. The missions can be trades, messages, investigations, etc.
    
    NPCs can be moved to new locations, or gathered for special scenes.
    Most conversations assume the Player is speaking with one NPC, but adding a companion won't take too much tweaking.
